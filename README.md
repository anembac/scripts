# Scripts
Simple scripts I've put together to make life easier.

## timer
Waits for the specified amount of time and then sends an alert. Input is 2-3 parameters, first is time in seconds to wait, second is title of alert and third is text of alert.
e.g. `./timer.sh 600 "Pasta" "Your pasta should be done cooking now!"` would set a timer for 10 minutes and then create a notify-send message telling you your pasta is ready.
